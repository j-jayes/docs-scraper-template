# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Agent Development Kit (ADK)! We welcome contributions to the core frameworks, documentation, and related components, which are listed below.

This guide provides information on how to get involved.

## Preparing to contribute¶

### Choose the right repository¶

The ADK project is split across several repositories. Find the right one for your contribution:

Repository | Description | Detailed Guide  
---|---|---  
[`google/adk-python`](https://github.com/google/adk-python) | Contains the core Python library source code | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-python-community`](https://github.com/google/adk-python-community) | Contains community-contributed tools, integrations, and scripts | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-python-community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-js`](https://github.com/google/adk-js) | Contains the core JavaScript library source code | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-go`](https://github.com/google/adk-go) | Contains the core Go library source code | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-go/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-java`](https://github.com/google/adk-java) | Contains the core Java library source code | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-docs`](https://github.com/google/adk-docs) | Contains the source for the documentation site you are currently reading | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-samples`](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) | Contains sample agents for ADK | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
[`google/adk-web`](https://github.com/google/adk-web) | Contains the source for the `adk web` dev UI |   
  
These repositories typically include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of their repository with more detailed information on requirements, testing, code review processes, etc. for that particular component.
