# Build your agent with ADK¶

Get started with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) through our collection of practical guides. These tutorials are designed in a simple, progressive, step-by-step fashion, introducing you to different ADK features and capabilities.

This approach allows you to learn and build incrementally – starting with foundational concepts and gradually tackling more advanced agent development techniques. You'll explore how to apply these features effectively across various use cases, equipping you to build your own sophisticated agentic applications with ADK. Explore our collection below and happy building:

  * **Multi-tool agent**

* * *

Create a workflow that uses multiple tools.

[ Build a multi-tool agent](../get-started/quickstart/)

  * **Agent team**

* * *

Build an multi-agent workflow including agent delegation, session management, and safety callbacks.

[ Build an agent team](agent-team/)

  * **Streaming agent**

* * *

Create an agent for handling streamed content.

[ Build a streaming agent](../get-started/streaming/)

  * **Discover sample agents**

* * *

Discover sample agents for retail, travel, customer service, and more!
