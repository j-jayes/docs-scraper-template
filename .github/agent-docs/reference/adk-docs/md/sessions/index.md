# Introduction to Conversational Context: Session, State, and Memory¶

Supported in ADKPythonTypeScriptGoJava

Meaningful, multi-turn conversations require agents to understand context. Just like humans, they need to recall the conversation history: what's been said and done to maintain continuity and avoid repetition. The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides structured ways to manage this context through `Session`, `State`, and `Memory`.

## Core Concepts¶

Think of different instances of your conversations with the agent as distinct **conversation threads** , potentially drawing upon **long-term knowledge**.

  1. **`Session`** : The Current Conversation Thread

     * Represents a _single, ongoing interaction_ between a user and your agent system.
     * Contains the chronological sequence of messages and actions taken by the agent (referred to `Events`) during _that specific interaction_.
     * A `Session` can also hold temporary data (`State`) relevant only _during this conversation_.
  2. **`State` (`session.state`)**: Data Within the Current Conversation

     * Data stored within a specific `Session`.
     * Used to manage information relevant _only_ to the _current, active_ conversation thread (e.g., items in a shopping cart _during this chat_ , user preferences mentioned _in this session_).
  3. **`Memory`** : Searchable, Cross-Session Information

     * Represents a store of information that might span _multiple past sessions_ or include external data sources.
     * It acts as a knowledge base the agent can _search_ to recall information or context beyond the immediate conversation.



## Managing Context: Services¶

ADK provides services to manage these concepts:

  1. **`SessionService`** : Manages the different conversation threads (`Session` objects)

     * Handles the lifecycle: creating, retrieving, updating (appending `Events`, modifying `State`), and deleting individual `Session`s.
  2. **`MemoryService`** : Manages the Long-Term Knowledge Store (`Memory`)

     * Handles ingesting information (often from completed `Session`s) into the long-term store.
     * Provides methods to search this stored knowledge based on queries.



**Implementations** : ADK offers different implementations for both `SessionService` and `MemoryService`, allowing you to choose the storage backend that best fits your application's needs. Notably, **in-memory implementations** are provided for both services; these are designed specifically for **local testing and fast development**. It's important to remember that **all data stored using these in-memory options (sessions, state, or long-term knowledge) is lost when your application restarts**. For persistence and scalability beyond local testing, ADK also offers cloud-based and database service options.

**In Summary:**

  * **`Session` & `State`**: Focus on the **current interaction** – the history and data of the _single, active conversation_. Managed primarily by a `SessionService`.
  * **Memory** : Focuses on the **past and external information** – a _searchable archive_ potentially spanning across conversations. Managed by a `MemoryService`.



## What's Next?¶

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these components:

  * **`Session`** : Understanding its structure and `Events`.
  * **`State`** : How to effectively read, write, and manage session-specific data.
  * **`SessionService`** : Choosing the right storage backend for your sessions.
  * **`MemoryService`** : Exploring options for storing and retrieving broader context.



Understanding these concepts is fundamental to building agents that can engage in complex, stateful, and context-aware conversations.
