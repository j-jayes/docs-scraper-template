# Apps: workflow management class¶

Supported in ADKPython v1.14.0

The **_App_** class is a top-level container for an entire Agent Development Kit (ADK) agent workflow. It is designed to manage the lifecycle, configuration, and state for a collection of agents grouped by a **_root agent_**. The **App** class separates the concerns of an agent workflow's overall operational infrastructure from individual agents' task-oriented reasoning. 

Defining an **_App_** object in your ADK workflow is optional and changes how you organize your agent code and run your agents. From a practical perspective, you use the **_App_** class to configure the following features for your agent workflow:

  * [**Context caching**](/adk-docs/context/caching/)
  * [**Context compression**](/adk-docs/context/compaction/)
  * [**Agent resume**](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/)
  * [**Plugins**](/adk-docs/plugins/)



This guide explains how to use the App class for configuring and managing your ADK agent workflows.

## Purpose of App Class¶

The **_App_** class addresses several architectural issues that arise when building complex agentic systems:

  * **Centralized configuration:** Provides a single, centralized location for managing shared resources like API keys and database clients, avoiding the need to pass configuration down through every agent.
  * **Lifecycle management:** The **_App_** class includes **_on startup_** and **_on shutdown_** hooks, which allow for reliable management of persistent resources such as database connection pools or in-memory caches that need to exist across multiple invocations.
  * **State scope:** It defines an explicit boundary for application-level state with an `app:*` prefix making the scope and lifetime of this state clear to developers.
  * **Unit of deployment:** The **_App_** concept establishes a formal _deployable unit_ , simplifying versioning, testing, and serving of agentic applications.



## Define an App object¶

The **_App_** class is used as the primary container of your agent workflow and contains the root agent of the project. The **_root agent_** is the container for the primary controller agent and any additonal sub-agents. 

### Define app with root agent¶

Create a **_root agent_** for your workflow by creating a subclass from the **_Agent_** base class. Then define an **_App_** object and configure it with the **_root agent_** object and optional features, as shown in the following sample code:

agent.py
    
    
    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
    from google.adk.apps import App
    
    root_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        name='greeter_agent',
        description='An agent that provides a friendly greeting.',
        instruction='Reply with Hello, World!',
    )
    
    app = App(
        name="agents",
        root_agent=root_agent,
        # Optionally include App-level features:
        # plugins, context_cache_config, resumability_config
    )
    

Recommended: Use `app` variable name

In your agent project code, set your **_App_** object to the variable name `app` so it is compatible with the ADK command line interface runner tools. 

### Run your App agent¶

You can use the **_Runner_** class to run your agent workflow using the `app` parameter, as shown in the following code sample:

main.py
    
    
    import asyncio
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
    from agent import app # import code from agent.py
    
    load_dotenv() # load API keys and settings
    # Set a Runner using the imported application object
    runner = InMemoryRunner(app=app)
    
    async def main():
        try:  # run_debug() requires ADK Python 1.18 or higher:
            response = await runner.run_debug("Hello there!")
    
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred during agent execution: {e}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    

Version requirement for `Runner.run_debug()`

The `Runner.run_debug()` command requires ADK Python v1.18.0 or higher. You can also use `Runner.run()`, which requires more setup code. For more details, see the 

Run your App agent with the `main.py` code using the following command:
    
    
    python main.py
    

## Next steps¶

For a more complete sample code implementation, see the [Hello World App](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/hello_world_app) code example.
