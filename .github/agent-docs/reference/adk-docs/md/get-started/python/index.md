# Python Quickstart for ADK¶

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Python. Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

  * Python 3.10 or later
  * `pip` for installing packages



## Installation¶

Install ADK by running the following command:
    
    
    pip install google-adk
    

Recommended: create and activate a Python virtual environment

Create a Python virtual environment:
    
    
    python -m venv .venv
    

Activate the Python virtual environment:

Windows CMDWindows PowershellMacOS / Linux
    
    
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    
    
    
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    
    
    
    source .venv/bin/activate
    

## Create an agent project¶

Run the `adk create` command to start a new agent project.
    
    
    adk create my_agent
    

### Explore the agent project¶

The created agent project has the following structure, with the `agent.py` file containing the main control code for the agent.
    
    
    my_agent/
        agent.py      # main agent code
        .env          # API keys or project IDs
        __init__.py
    

## Update your agent project¶

The `agent.py` file contains a `root_agent` definition which is the only required element of an ADK agent. You can also define tools for the agent to use. Update the generated `agent.py` code to include a `get_current_time` tool for use by the agent, as shown in the following code:
    
    
    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
    
    # Mock tool implementation
    def get_current_time(city: str) -> dict:
        """Returns the current time in a specified city."""
        return {"status": "success", "city": city, "time": "10:30 AM"}
    
    root_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-3-flash-preview',
        name='root_agent',
        description="Tells the current time in a specified city.",
        instruction="You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in cities. Use the 'get_current_time' tool for this purpose.",
        tools=[get_current_time],
    )
    

### Set your API key¶

This project uses the Gemini API, which requires an API key. If you don't already have Gemini API key, create a key in Google AI Studio on the [API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

In a terminal window, write your API key into an `.env` file as an environment variable:

Update: my_agent/.env
    
    
    echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
    

Using other AI models with ADK

ADK supports the use of many generative AI models. For more information on configuring other models in ADK agents, see [Models & Authentication](/adk-docs/agents/models).

## Run your agent¶

You can run your ADK agent with an interactive command-line interface using the `adk run` command or the ADK web user interface provided by the ADK using the `adk web` command. Both these options allow you to test and interact with your agent.

### Run with command-line interface¶

Run your agent using the `adk run` command-line tool.
    
    
    adk run my_agent
    

### Run with web interface¶

The ADK framework provides web interface you can use to test and interact with your agent. You can start the web interface using the following command:
    
    
    adk web --port 8000
    

Note

Run this command from the **parent directory** that contains your `my_agent/` folder. For example, if your agent is inside `agents/my_agent/`, run `adk web` from the `agents/` directory.

This command starts a web server with a chat interface for your agent. You can access the web interface at (http://localhost:8000). Select the agent at the upper left corner and type a request.

Caution: ADK Web for development only

ADK Web is **_not meant for use in production deployments_**. You should use ADK Web for development and debugging purposes only.

## Next: Build your agent¶

Now that you have ADK installed and your first agent running, try building your own agent with our build guides:
