# Agent Development Kit (ADK)¶

**Build, Evaluate and Deploy agents, seamlessly!**

ADK is designed to empower developers to build, manage, evaluate and deploy AI-powered agents. It provides a robust and flexible environment for creating both conversational and non-conversational agents, capable of handling complex tasks and workflows.

## Core Concepts¶

ADK is built around a few key primitives and concepts that make it powerful and flexible. Here are the essentials:

  * **Agent:** The fundamental worker unit designed for specific tasks. Agents can use language models (`LlmAgent`) for complex reasoning, or act as deterministic controllers of the execution, which are called "[workflow agents](../../agents/workflow-agents/)" (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`).
  * **Tool:** Gives agents abilities beyond conversation, letting them interact with external APIs, search information, run code, or call other services.
  * **Callbacks:** Custom code snippets you provide to run at specific points in the agent's process, allowing for checks, logging, or behavior modifications.
  * **Session Management (`Session` & `State`):** Handles the context of a single conversation (`Session`), including its history (`Events`) and the agent's working memory for that conversation (`State`).
  * **Memory:** Enables agents to recall information about a user across _multiple_ sessions, providing long-term context (distinct from short-term session `State`).
  * **Artifact Management (`Artifact`):** Allows agents to save, load, and manage files or binary data (like images, PDFs) associated with a session or user.
  * **Code Execution:** The ability for agents (usually via Tools) to generate and execute code to perform complex calculations or actions.
  * **Planning:** An advanced capability where agents can break down complex goals into smaller steps and plan how to achieve them like a ReAct planner.
  * **Models:** The underlying LLM that powers `LlmAgent`s, enabling their reasoning and language understanding abilities.
  * **Event:** The basic unit of communication representing things that happen during a session (user message, agent reply, tool use), forming the conversation history.
  * **Runner:** The engine that manages the execution flow, orchestrates agent interactions based on Events, and coordinates with backend services.



_**Note:** Features like Multimodal Streaming, Evaluation, Deployment, Debugging, and Trace are also part of the broader ADK ecosystem, supporting real-time interaction and the development lifecycle._

## Key Capabilities¶

ADK offers several key advantages for developers building agentic applications:

  1. **Multi-Agent System Design:** Easily build applications composed of multiple, specialized agents arranged hierarchically. Agents can coordinate complex tasks, delegate sub-tasks using LLM-driven transfer or explicit `AgentTool` invocation, enabling modular and scalable solutions.
  2. **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Equip agents with diverse capabilities. ADK supports integrating custom functions (`FunctionTool`), using other agents as tools (`AgentTool`), leveraging built-in functionalities like code execution, and interacting with external data sources and APIs (e.g., Search, Databases). Support for long-running tools allows handling asynchronous operations effectively.
  3. **Flexible Orchestration:** Define complex agent workflows using built-in workflow agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`) alongside LLM-driven dynamic routing. This allows for both predictable pipelines and adaptive agent behavior.
  4. **Integrated Developer Tooling:** Develop and iterate locally with ease. ADK includes tools like a command-line interface (CLI) and a Developer UI for running agents, inspecting execution steps (events, state changes), debugging interactions, and visualizing agent definitions.
  5. **Native Streaming Support:** Build real-time, interactive experiences with native support for bidirectional streaming (text and audio). This integrates seamlessly with underlying capabilities like the [Multimodal Live API for the Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) (or for [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/multimodal-live)), often enabled with simple configuration changes.
  6. **Built-in Agent Evaluation:** Assess agent performance systematically. The framework includes tools to create multi-turn evaluation datasets and run evaluations locally (via CLI or the dev UI) to measure quality and guide improvements.
  7. **Broad LLM Support:** While optimized for Google's Gemini models, the framework is designed for flexibility, allowing integration with various LLMs (potentially including open-source or fine-tuned models) through its `BaseLlm` interface.
  8. **Artifact Management:** Enable agents to handle files and binary data. The framework provides mechanisms (`ArtifactService`, context methods) for agents to save, load, and manage versioned artifacts like images, documents, or generated reports during their execution.
  9. **Extensibility and Interoperability:** ADK promotes an open ecosystem. While providing core tools, it allows developers to easily integrate and reuse third-party tools and data connectors.
  10. **State and Memory Management:** Automatically handles short-term conversational memory (`State` within a `Session`) managed by the `SessionService`. Provides integration points for longer-term `Memory` services, allowing agents to recall user information across multiple sessions.
