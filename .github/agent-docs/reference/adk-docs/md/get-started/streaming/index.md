# Build a streaming agent¶

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) enables real-time, interactive experiences with your AI agents through streaming. This allows for features like live voice conversations, real-time tool use, and continuous updates from your agent.

This page provides quickstart examples to get you up and running with streaming capabilities in both Python and Java ADK.

  * **Python ADK: Streaming agent**

* * *

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic streaming interaction with an agent using Python ADK. It typically involves using the `Runner.run_live()` method and handling asynchronous events.

  * **Java ADK: Streaming agent**

* * *

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic streaming interaction with an agent using Java ADK. It involves using the `Runner.runLive()` method, a `LiveRequestQueue`, and handling the `Flowable<Event>` stream.
