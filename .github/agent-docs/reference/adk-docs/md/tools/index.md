# Tools for Agents¶

Check out the following pre-built tools that you can use with ADK agents:

### Gemini tools¶

### [Google Search Perform web searches using Google Search with Gemini ](/adk-docs/tools/gemini-api/google-search/) ### [Code Execution Execute code and debug using Gemini models ](/adk-docs/tools/gemini-api/code-execution/) ### [Computer Use Operate computer user interfaces using Gemini models ](/adk-docs/tools/gemini-api/computer-use/)

### Google Cloud tools¶

### [Apigee API Hub Turn any documented API from Apigee API hub into a tool ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/apigee-api-hub/) ### [API Registry Dynamically connect with Google Cloud services as MCP tools ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/api-registry/) ### [Application Integration Link your agents to enterprise apps using Integration Connectors ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/application-integration/) ### [BigQuery Agent Analytics Analyze and debug agent behavior at scale ](/adk-docs/observability/bigquery-agent-analytics/) ### [BigQuery Tools Connect with BigQuery to retrieve data and perform analysis ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/bigquery/) ### [Bigtable Tools Interact with Bigtable to retrieve data and execute SQL ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/bigtable/) ### [GKE Code Executor Run AI-generated code in a secure and scalable GKE environment ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/gke-code-executor/) ### [Spanner Tools Interact with Spanner to retrieve data, search, and execute SQL ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/spanner/) ### [MCP Toolbox for Databases Connect over 30 different data sources to your agents ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/mcp-toolbox-for-databases/) ### [Vertex AI RAG Engine Perform private data retrieval using Vertex AI RAG Engine ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/vertex-ai-rag-engine/) ### [Vertex AI Search Search across your private, configured data stores in Vertex AI Search ](/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud/vertex-ai-search/)

### Third-party tools¶

### [Atlassian Manage issues, search pages, and update team content ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/atlassian/) ### [GitHub Analyze code, manage issues and PRs, and automate workflows ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/github/) ### [GitLab Perform semantic code search, inspect pipelines, manage merge requests ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/gitlab/) ### [Hugging Face Access models, datasets, research papers, and AI tools ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/hugging-face/) ### [Linear Manage issues, track projects, and streamline development ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/linear/) ### [n8n Trigger automated workflows, connect apps, and process data ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/n8n/) ### [Notion Search workspaces, create pages, and manage tasks and databases ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/notion/) ### [Paypal Manage payments, send invoices, and handle subscriptions ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/paypal/) ### [Qdrant Store and retrieve information using semantic vector search ](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/qdrant/)

## Use pre-built tools with ADK agents¶

Follow these general steps to include tools in your ADK agents:

  1. **Import:** Import the desired tool from the tools module. This is `agents.tools` in Python, `@google/adk` in TypeScript, `google.golang.org/adk/tool` in Go, or `com.google.adk.tools` in Java.
  2. **Configure:** Initialize the tool, providing required parameters if any.
  3. **Register:** Add the initialized tool to the **_tools_** list of your Agent.



Once added to an agent, the agent can decide to use the tool based on the user prompt and its instructions. The framework handles the execution of the tool when the agent calls it.

Note: Limitations on using multiple tools

Some ADK tools **_cannot be used with other tools in the same agent_**. For more information on tools with these limitations, see [Limitations for ADK tools](/adk-docs/tools/limitations/#one-tool-one-agent).

## Build tools for agents¶

If the above tools don't meet your needs, you can build tools for your ADK workflows using the following guides:

  * **[Function Tools](/adk-docs/tools-custom/function-tools/)** : Build custom tools for your specific ADK agent needs.
  * **[MCP Tools](/adk-docs/tools-custom/mcp-tools/)** : Connect MCP servers as tools for your ADK agents.
  * **[OpenAPI Integration](/adk-docs/tools-custom/openapi-tools/)** : Generate callable tools directly from an OpenAPI Specification.
